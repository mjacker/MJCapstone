# Machine Learning based on Intrusion Detection
In order to detect malicious activity in a network a machine learning is used to analyze the traffic behaviour in the network, and take desicion based in a pre-train model.

This proyect code is trained using the public dataset from CSE-CIC-IDS2018 on AWS, specifically the first two days.
