# Machine Learning based on Intrusion Detection
In order to detect malicious activity in a network a machine learning is used to analyze the traffic behaviour in the network, and take desicion based in a pre-train model.

This proyect code is trained using the public dataset from CSE-CIC-IDS2018 on AWS, specifically the first two days. 

You can run this repository directly in a Google Colab environment in the following url [Open Google Colab.](https://githubtocolab.com/mjacker/MJCapstone/blob/master/0_merged_ipynb_files_for_google_colab.ipynb)

Otherwise you can clone this repository, then install a venv enviroment using de requirements files to try it by yourself.

## IDS - Intrusion Detection System
The Intrusion Detection System developed can identify various types of cyber-attacks to protect modern networks by analysing network traffic behavior.
